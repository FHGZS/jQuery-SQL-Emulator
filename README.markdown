jQuery SQL Emulator
===

A simple SQL parser and pretend-database written in JavaScript with jQuery. It can be used to teach students simple SELECT SQL statements without access to a real database. The database here is basically a JSON object.

Joins, update, insert and delete statements are not implemented.

You can read about implementation details [on my blog](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2009/05/12/sql-emulation-tool-in-javascript/).

Dependencies:
---

  - jQuery (included)
  - jQuery.string plugin by David E. Still (also included)
